# Airline Mangement System
 The idea of this project is like a real-life example of an airline ticket booking system where customers directly interact with the receptionist on the booking counter to book their desired flight tickets.


## Working Of Project

Firstly, the customer will be displayed the menu to enter their desired choice.

</div>

Secondly, the customer would select available cities and start their booking by entering the current location and destination. The user will enter departure date, number of passengers they want to book the ticket for their personal information and it will provide serial numbers to passengers as well as a random booking code of a single person or if tickets are reserved for a family, the family would then have only one booking code after selecting the timing of flights.

The user will now press 2, which will calculate the ticket price according to the number of passengers of a particular user-inputted booking code, noting that the tickets will have some discounts on children and old age passengers traveling.

</div>

The user can view the ticket details of a particular booking code which will show the full ticket of a passenger with their information and individual fare.

User can also modify any ticket through its serial number if a passenger has provided with incorrect information.

If you view the ticket details again, the modified information of the serial number will be displayed.
